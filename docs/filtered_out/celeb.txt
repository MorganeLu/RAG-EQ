Ellen DeGeneres, who’s relocated to the U.K., has successfully unloaded a remaining piece of her American real estate portfolio, with the sale of a two-bedroom villa in star-studded Montecito, California, for $5.2 million. 

The home, which the comedian and former  daytime talk show host shared with her wife, Portia de Rossi, listed less than two weeks ago for $4.995 million, went into contract just four days later and closed on Thursday, according to Forbes Global Properties, the brokerage that represented the sellers.

The single-story home just outside Santa Barbara spans 1,691 square feet and sports an open floor plan for the common areas, an enclosed courtyard with a fire pit and two patios. Built in 1954, the cottage-like home features gently sloped wood-beamed ceilings painted white, a chef’s kitchen and large cherry wood-framed windows to let in the light. It’s located just a few minutes from Butterfly beach and from the Route 101 freeway.

DeGeneres and de Rossi bought the home for $2.9 million in 2020, but are currently shedding their many real estate holdings in the U.S., as they settle in the U.K. likely for the long term. The duo are among several high-profile celebrities to move abroad after Donald Trump’s second presidential election victory, out of concern for his administration’s policies and rollback of civil rights.
