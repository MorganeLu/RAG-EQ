## Conflict with Colleagues

### Strategy & Principles
- Be solution-focused, not blame-focused.
- Use curiosity to explore their perspective: “Help me understand…”
- Listen deeply before responding.
- Express your needs and emotions clearly and respectfully.
- Reaffirm your commitment to collaboration.

### Role-Specific Tips
- Avoid escalation through gossip; address issues directly.
- Choose neutral timing and a private setting for conversations.
- Establish shared goals and acknowledge mutual stress or constraints.
- Don’t assume malice — often, people are unaware of the impact of their actions.

## 20 Fully Developed Conflict Examples

---

### **Example 1: Repeated Interruptions in Meetings**

**Context:** During brainstorming sessions, your colleague frequently interrupts you, making it difficult for you to express your ideas.

**What they said:**  
“I just want to say something quickly—actually, I think we should pivot entirely and try something else.”

**Your response:**  
“Hey, can I share something I’ve been noticing? In a few of our recent meetings, I’ve felt cut off when I was speaking. I understand you’re excited to contribute—we all are—but I’d really appreciate the chance to finish my thoughts. I think we can build stronger ideas if we make space for everyone.”

---

### **Example 2: Taking Credit for Your Work**

**Context:** Your colleague presented an analysis you created to leadership without acknowledging your contribution.

**What they said:**  
“So I put together this analysis and here’s what we found…”

**Your response:**  
“Hey, great job on presenting the findings today. I did notice that my role in the analysis wasn’t mentioned, and that surprised me a bit. I put a lot of effort into pulling that data and building the visualizations. I know it might have been an oversight, but in the future, I’d appreciate being acknowledged when my work is shared.”

---

### **Example 3: Missed Deadlines Impacting Your Work**

**Context:** You’re dependent on their task to move your portion forward, but they keep submitting work late.

**What they said:**  
“Sorry I didn’t get it done again. Things have just been crazy lately.”

**Your response:**  
“I totally get that things get hectic—it happens to all of us. At the same time, when this part is delayed, it pushes my timeline back, too. Can we talk about how we might adjust deadlines or redistribute work so we’re both set up for success?”

---

### **Example 4: Passive-Aggressive Email**

**Context:** You receive an email filled with sarcasm and pointed commentary about a mistake.

**What they wrote:**  
“Well, I assume *someone* thought it was a good idea to ignore the new process…”

**Your response (in person or via call):**  
“I got your email, and I sensed some frustration. I want to make sure I understand what’s going on so we can resolve it. If I made a mistake or missed a change in process, I’d rather talk about it directly so we can clear things up and move forward.”

---

### **Example 5: Micromanaging or Overstepping**

**Context:** Your colleague frequently checks in on your tasks and suggests how you should complete them, though it's not their responsibility.

**What they said:**  
“Just checking—did you send that follow-up email yet? You should probably say XYZ too.”

**Your response:**  
“I appreciate that you’re looking out for the details. At the same time, I’m comfortable owning this piece of the work. If something’s falling short, I’m definitely open to feedback, but I’d like to manage my tasks independently when possible.”

---

### **Example 6: Venting About You to Others**

**Context:** Another team member informs you that your colleague has been talking negatively about your performance.

**What they said (to others):**  
“I don’t know why they’re always so slow on these things. I end up having to clean it up.”

**Your response:**  
“I heard that you were feeling frustrated with how I handled a recent task. I’d really appreciate it if, in the future, you could come to me directly. I’m totally open to feedback, and I want us to have a professional, constructive working relationship.”

---

### **Example 7: Unresponsive to Collaboration**

**Context:** You’re assigned a joint task, but your colleague doesn't respond to your messages or invites.

**What they did:**  
Ignored Slack messages, skipped check-in meetings.

**Your response:**  
“I’ve been trying to get in touch about our shared task and haven’t heard back. I know we’re all juggling a lot, but I want to make sure we’re aligned so we can move this forward. Is there a good time this week to sync up?”

---

### **Example 8: Unclear Role Boundaries**

**Context:** You both take initiative on the same deliverable, leading to redundant work and confusion.

**What they said:**  
“Well, I already finalized that. I didn’t think we needed to discuss it.”

**Your response:**  
“I think we might have had slightly different understandings of who was handling that task. To avoid overlap and make things more efficient, could we clarify roles on this project together?”

---

### **Example 9: Public Criticism**

**Context:** Your colleague criticized your work or made a snide remark during a team meeting.

**What they said:**  
“Well, I guess not everyone double-checks their numbers before hitting send.”

**Your response (privately):**  
“When you said that in the meeting, it caught me off guard. I’d prefer if we could have that kind of conversation one-on-one. I want to keep things professional and would never want to undermine you publicly either.”

---

### **Example 10: Ignoring Your Input**

**Context:** Your suggestions in team discussions are consistently brushed off or dismissed.

**What they did:**  
Didn’t acknowledge or respond when you presented an idea, even when others did.

**Your response:**  
“I’ve noticed that when I share ideas in meetings, they don’t always seem to land or get addressed. I’m wondering if there’s a way I can better frame them, or if you’re hearing something different in what I’m proposing. I’d like to contribute more meaningfully.”

---

### **Example 11: They Monopolize Group Discussions**

**Context:** They talk extensively and dominate team discussions, leaving little room for others.

**Your response:**  
“I really value your insights—they’re clearly well thought out. I also think the rest of the team has great ideas. Could we experiment with a round-robin format or ask the facilitator to make sure everyone gets a turn?”

---

### **Example 12: Disagreement on Strategy**

**Context:** You fundamentally disagree on how to solve a shared problem and it’s stalling progress.

**What they said:**  
“We’ve already tried your way—it doesn’t work. We’re wasting time.”

**Your response:**  
“Sounds like we both have strong convictions, which is a good thing. Can we take 10 minutes to lay out the pros and cons of each approach and see if a hybrid might work?”

---

### **Example 13: Excluded from Key Communications**

**Context:** You weren’t included on a thread or meeting that affects your work.

**What they did:**  
Scheduled decisions and shared information without involving you.

**Your response:**  
“I noticed I wasn’t looped in on the last conversation about the rollout, even though it affects my tasks. I’d appreciate being included in those conversations going forward—it helps me plan better and avoid mistakes.”

---

### **Example 14: Conflicting Work Styles**

**Context:** You prefer structure and deadlines; your colleague is more fluid and last-minute.

**Your response:**  
“I know we approach work differently—I like a tighter schedule, while you work more iteratively. Maybe we can agree on a few key milestones so we each have the space to work in our own way but still stay aligned.”

---

### **Example 15: Cultural Misunderstanding**

**Context:** A joke or comment your colleague made felt inappropriate to you.

**What they said:**  
“It’s just a saying—it’s not that deep.”

**Your response:**  
“I get that you didn’t mean any harm, but that phrase has a different connotation for me culturally, and it made me uncomfortable. I thought I’d let you know, just so we can be mindful in the future.”

---

### **Example 16: They Misread Your Intent**

**Context:** Your actions were misinterpreted as passive-aggressive or uncooperative.

**What they said:**  
“I felt like you were giving me attitude in that email.”

**Your response:**  
“Thanks for bringing that up—I actually didn’t mean it that way at all. I can totally see how the tone might have come off that way in writing. I’ll be more mindful going forward, and feel free to check in if something doesn’t land right.”

---

### **Example 17: Disrespectful Tone**

**Context:** Their tone in messages or conversation feels condescending or harsh.

**Your response:**  
“Can I share something with you? Sometimes the tone in our conversations feels a bit sharp to me. I’m sure it’s not intentional, but it makes it harder for me to engage openly. I want to make sure we’re both comfortable collaborating.”

---

### **Example 18: Accusations of Not Pulling Your Weight**

**Context:** Your colleague suggests you haven’t contributed equally.

**What they said:**  
“I don’t know what you’ve even done on this project so far.”

**Your response:**  
“I’d like to clear that up. I’ve been working on X, Y, and Z in the background. If it’s not been visible, I’ll do a better job of communicating my progress. I also want to understand what you feel is missing so we can stay aligned.”

---

### **Example 19: Differences in Ambition or Pace**

**Context:** You’re highly driven and goal-oriented, and your colleague seems to be less motivated or detail-oriented.

**Your response:**  
“I know I tend to move quickly and push for precision. I also want to respect your process. Let’s talk about where we can align on pace and output expectations so we’re both comfortable.”

---

### **Example 20: Personal Values Triggered by Behavior**

**Context:** You’re frustrated because their behavior violates a value you hold, such as transparency or fairness.

**Your response:**  
“I want to be honest—something in this situation is triggering a core value I have around [transparency/fairness/etc.]. I’d love to talk about how we might address that concern while still supporting the team’s goals.”
