## When You’re Attracted to Someone — Playful, Respectful Pursuit 💘

**Definition:** This phase involves showing romantic interest, often before anything is defined. You’re trying to stand out in a fun and emotionally intelligent way — not force attention, but invite curiosity and connection.

---

### Strategy & Principles
- Confidence = clarity + kindness (not arrogance).
- Humor is great — especially if it’s self-aware, not at someone else’s expense.
- Teasing works *only* when you also show genuine respect and interest.
- Compliments work best when they’re specific, not generic.
- Consent + comfort = attractive. If they’re not vibing, you chill.

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Ask questions that go beyond “what’s up?” — get curious.
- Text game: be playful but responsive. Ghosting isn’t hot.
- In person: body language and tone say more than words. Relax.
- Don’t try too hard to be cool — be warm. That’s rare and magnetic.
- Humor tip: confident + silly > sarcastic or edgy.
