## Navigating Interactions with Teachers / Professors

**Definition:** Teachers and professors are authority figures in academic settings who design learning experiences, assess performance, and often serve as mentors. Students benefit from building respectful, communicative relationships that balance assertiveness with humility.

---

### Strategy & Principles
- Respect their expertise, time, and boundaries while advocating for your own needs.
- Use email or office hours for clarification, not public challenges during class.
- Focus on asking for support, not proving a point.
- Avoid entitlement — lead with gratitude, then raise your concern.
- Acknowledge power dynamics while still owning your voice and perspective.

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Use formal communication, especially in writing (e.g., “Dear Professor,” “Sincerely…”).
- Be concise and clear — professors are often managing many students.
- When challenging feedback or grades, focus on process, not fairness.
- If you’re struggling emotionally, be honest about what support you need.
- Positive interactions matter — professors notice engagement, curiosity, and kindness.

## 20 Fully Developed Student–Professor Scenarios

### **Example 1: Disagreeing with a Grade**

**Context:** You received a lower grade than expected on an essay you worked hard on.

**What they said:**  
“The thesis lacked clarity and the evidence was underdeveloped.”

**Your response (email or in office hours):**  
“Thank you for the feedback on my paper. I’d love to better understand where I missed the mark so I can improve on the next one. Would you be open to reviewing a few parts of the assignment with me in office hours?”

---

### **Example 2: Needing an Extension**

**Context:** You’re overwhelmed and need more time to complete a major assignment.

**Your response (email):**  
“Dear Professor [Last Name], I’ve been managing some unexpected personal challenges this week and I’m concerned I won’t be able to submit my best work by the deadline. Would it be possible to request a short extension? I fully understand if not and will submit the current draft if needed.”

### **Example 3: They Dismissed Your Question in Class**

**Context:** You asked a question, and the professor brushed it off quickly.

**What they said:**  
“That’s not really relevant. Let’s move on.”

**Your response (after class or in email):**

### **Example 4: You Feel Intimidated Asking for Help**

**Context:** The professor is highly respected, and you're struggling in the course.

**Your response (email):**

---

### **Example 5: They Mispronounce or Misgender You**

**Context:** They consistently use the wrong name or pronoun.

### **Example 6: You Missed Class and Need Notes**

**Context:** You were absent due to illness or personal issues.

### **Example 9: Feeling Disrespected in Feedback**

“This is sloppy work. Did you even proofread it?”

**Your response (in person or by email):**  
“I wanted to check in about your comments on my last paper. I recognize I made mistakes, but the tone felt a bit discouraging. I’d like to learn from this, and it would help to receive feedback that focuses on improvement.”

---

### **Example 10: You Forgot a Deadline**

**Context:** You missed a due date and want to take responsibility without excuses.

**What they said:**  
“You’re being overly sensitive — it’s just part of the material.”

**Your response (after class):**  
“I wanted to revisit our discussion earlier. The example used felt uncomfortable, and when I raised it, I didn’t feel heard. I’m not trying to attack the material — I just hoped we could acknowledge how it might land differently for different students.”

**Context:** You start to speak, and they cut you off or dismiss the question.
