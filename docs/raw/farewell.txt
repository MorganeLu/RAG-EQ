## Tips for Writing Your Own

- **Be specific**: Mention the holiday by name or refer to what the holiday means (rest, family, reflection, tradition).
- **Be personal**: Add one line about what they mean to you, or what you hope for them.
- **Be inclusive**: If unsure what they celebrate, use neutral phrasing like *"the holiday season," "this week’s celebrations," or "whatever you're celebrating."*
- **Be brief**: One thoughtful sentence is better than a generic paragraph.
