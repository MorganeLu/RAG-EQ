## Conflict with Direct Reports (People You Manage)

**Definition:** Direct reports are employees or junior team members you manage. Conflict may stem from unmet expectations, resistance to feedback, performance issues, miscommunication, or perceived unfairness. Your goal is to resolve tensions while maintaining authority, trust, and psychological safety.

---

### Strategy & Principles
- Lead with calm authority and empathy — model emotional regulation.
- Be clear and consistent in expectations, but flexible in delivery.
- Balance care and accountability — build trust without avoiding difficult conversations.
- Use coaching over commanding: guide reflection rather than dictate solutions.
- Reinforce a culture of transparency, shared purpose, and growth.

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Avoid surprises — set clear goals, timelines, and check-in structures.
- Give specific, timely, and actionable feedback.
- Don’t make it personal — focus on the behavior or outcome.
- Use private, non-threatening spaces for 1-on-1 feedback.
- Praise in public, correct in private — always aim to preserve dignity.

## 20 Fully Developed Conflict Examples with Direct Reports

---

### **Example 1: Missed Deadlines**

**Context:** A team member consistently turns in work after the agreed deadline.

**What they said:**  
“I had too many things going on and couldn’t prioritize it.”

**Your response:**  
“I understand competing demands can make things hard to juggle. At the same time, when deadlines slip, it affects downstream tasks. Let’s look at what got in the way and make a plan to manage timelines more effectively moving forward.”

---

### **Example 2: Low-Quality Work**

**Context:** A deliverable lacks attention to detail, requiring rework.

**What they said:**  
“I thought it was good enough.”

**Your response:**  
“I appreciate you getting it done on time. That said, there were several quality issues we had to fix before sharing. Can we walk through the feedback together? I want to make sure we’re aligned on what 'good enough' means for our team and clients.”

---

### **Example 3: Defensive Response to Feedback**

**Context:** They get visibly defensive when you give constructive input.

**What they said:**  
“I don’t think that’s fair — I was doing my best.”

**Your response:**  
“I hear that this feedback feels hard — I respect that you’re giving your best effort. Feedback isn’t about effort—it’s about impact. I want to support your growth, and part of that is looking at what we can do even better next time. Let’s talk through it.”

---

### **Example 4: Frequent Tardiness**

**Context:** They often show up late to meetings or arrive late to work.

**What they said:**  
“Traffic was crazy again. It’s not a big deal, right?”

**Your response:**  
“I know delays happen from time to time, but this has been a pattern. When meetings start late, it sends a message to others and disrupts flow. Let’s figure out what adjustments can help you arrive consistently on time.”

---

### **Example 5: Not Taking Initiative**

**Context:** You’ve asked them to take more ownership, but they remain passive.

**What they said:**  
“I was waiting for instructions.”

**Your response:**  
“I want to be clear—I value initiative on this team. That means stepping in and making decisions within your scope, even if they’re imperfect. What’s holding you back from being more proactive? Let’s identify ways to help you feel confident leading in your role.”

---

### **Example 6: Talking Over Others in Meetings**

**Context:** They dominate discussions and don’t leave space for quieter voices.

**What they said:**  
“I was just passionate about my point.”

**Your response:**  
“I love your energy and conviction — it brings great ideas. At the same time, I’ve noticed it sometimes prevents others from contributing. Can we work on balancing airtime in meetings so all voices are heard?”

---

### **Example 7: Negative Attitude or Cynicism**

**Context:** They frequently complain or express skepticism during team discussions.

**What they said:**  
“This won’t work. We’ve already tried it.”

**Your response:**  
“I value your experience and want to hear concerns, but the way they’re expressed matters. When ideas are shut down immediately, it dampens team morale. If something isn’t viable, I’d love for you to also offer a possible alternative.”

---

### **Example 8: Gossiping or Undermining Peers**

**Context:** You’ve received feedback that they’ve been speaking negatively about team members.

**What they said:**  
“I was just venting. I didn’t mean anything by it.”

---

### **Example 9: Disrespecting Your Authority**

**Context:** They dismiss your guidance or challenge you openly in meetings.

**What they said:**  
“I don’t agree, and I don’t think we should do it your way.”

---

### **Example 10: Overconfidence Without Delivery**

**Context:** They overpromise and underdeliver, creating risk for the team.

**What they said:**  
“I got this — don’t worry about it.”

---

### **Example 11: Avoiding Responsibility**

**Context:** They deflect blame when mistakes happen.

**What they said:**  
“That wasn’t really my fault — the instructions weren’t clear.”

---

### **Example 12: Not Following Through**

**Context:** They agree in meetings but don’t follow up.

**What they said:**  
“Oh—I forgot about that part.”

---

### **Example 15: Conflict with Another Team Member**

**Context:** They’re not getting along with a peer, affecting collaboration.

**What they said:**  
“I just don’t like working with them.”

“Whatever. Just get back to me when you decide.”

### **Example 19: Misuse of Time or Resources**

**Context:** They spend time on non-work tasks during business hours or misuse tools.

**What they did:**  
Browsing social media or using the team Slack to chat off-topic during busy hours.

**Context:** You’ve given multiple rounds of coaching, but they’re still underperforming.

**What they said:**  
“I thought I was doing better…”
