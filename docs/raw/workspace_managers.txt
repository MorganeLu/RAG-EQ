## Conflict with Mentors / Managers

### Strategy & Principles
- Respect the power dynamic, but don’t suppress your needs.
- Focus on mutual goals (growth, performance, success).
- Be solutions-oriented — bring up concerns with potential paths forward.
- Use curiosity and non-defensiveness to invite open dialogue.
- Separate intent from impact: managers often intend well but may misstep.

### Role-Specific Tips
- Acknowledge their role and authority first; show appreciation.
- Focus on how the issue impacts your ability to do your best work or grow.
- Don’t demand, but advocate clearly and calmly.
- Use evidence or examples to back up your points without sounding accusatory.
- Frame issues as opportunities for alignment or clarity.

## 20 Fully Developed Conflict Scenarios with Managers/Mentors

---

### **Example 1: Micromanagement**

**Context:** Your manager frequently checks in on your tasks and gives overly detailed instructions.

**What they said:**  
“Can you copy me on every email you send to the client and run the final version by me before sending?”

**Your response:**  
“I know how important this client is, and I want to meet expectations. At the same time, I’ve noticed I’m being asked to get signoff on things I typically handle independently. Is there something specific I can improve on that’s led to the extra oversight? If not, I’d love to talk about how we might rebuild more autonomy.”

---

### **Example 2: Lack of Clear Feedback**

**Context:** You’re unsure how your performance is being perceived and feel stuck.

**What they said:**  
“Yeah, you’re doing fine.”

**Your response:**  
“I really appreciate the trust, and I’m glad to hear things are going well. That said, I’m hungry for more specific feedback so I can grow faster. Could we schedule a quick check-in to go over what’s working and where I could stretch myself more?”

---

### **Example 3: Unfair Distribution of Work**

**Context:** You’re consistently assigned heavier workloads than others on the team.

**What they said:**  
“I know it’s a lot, but you’re one of the more capable team members.”

**Your response:**  
“I appreciate that you trust me with important work—it means a lot. At the same time, I’ve noticed a pattern where I’m handling a higher volume than others. I want to be a team player, but I’m also trying to manage sustainability and quality. Could we take a look together at how work is being distributed?”

---

### **Example 4: Public Criticism**

**Context:** Your manager criticized you harshly in front of others.

**What they said:**  
“This report is unacceptable. How did this even get past your review?”

**Your response (privately):**  
“I want to take responsibility for what didn’t go well in the report. At the same time, being called out in front of others felt difficult. If there’s feedback, I’d prefer to hear it one-on-one so I can absorb it and respond constructively.”

---

### **Example 5: Ignoring Your Career Goals**

**Context:** You’ve expressed interest in learning new skills, but your manager continues assigning you the same types of tasks.

**What they said:**  
“For now, let’s just stick to what you’re already good at.”

**Your response:**  
“I get that consistency is important, and I want to continue delivering strong results. At the same time, I’d love to gradually expand into [specific area]. Could we identify one stretch assignment or small step in that direction while maintaining our current priorities?”

---

### **Example 6: They Don’t Listen to Your Ideas**

**Context:** You suggest improvements, but your ideas are often dismissed without discussion.

**What they said:**  
“That’s not really the way we do things here.”

**Your response:**  
“I respect that there are existing processes for good reason. I also want to contribute ideas when I see opportunities. Would you be open to a 15-minute session where I could walk through the rationale and get your take?”

---

### **Example 7: Ambiguity in Priorities**

**Context:** Your manager gives conflicting messages about which tasks are most important.

**What they said:**  
“Both of these need to be done by tomorrow.”

**Your response:**  
“I want to make sure I’m delivering what’s most important, but I’m seeing competing deadlines here. Could you help me prioritize so I focus my time where it matters most?”

---

### **Example 8: Your Manager Is Overwhelmed and Unavailable**

**Context:** Your mentor or manager is often too busy to support you or provide timely input.

**What they said:**  
“Sorry, I’m swamped. Can you just figure it out?”

**Your response:**  
“I understand things are hectic, and I’ve been doing my best to work independently. That said, I’m getting stuck on [specific decision] and would benefit from a quick check-in. Even 10 minutes would really help me stay on track.”

---

### **Example 9: Negative or Demoralizing Tone**

**Context:** Their tone in feedback or interactions consistently feels harsh or discouraging.

**What they said:**  
“This just isn’t good enough. I don’t know why this keeps happening.”

**Your response (privately):**  
“I want to get things right, and I’m taking your feedback seriously. I’d also like to share that when feedback comes in strongly like that, it sometimes shuts me down rather than helping me improve. I’d love to find a way to keep things direct but constructive.”

---

### **Example 10: Not Advocating for You**

**Context:** Your manager doesn’t speak up for your promotion or protect you in cross-functional situations.

**What they said (or didn’t):**  
Didn’t mention your work in front of leadership, or didn’t support you in a conflict.

**Your response:**  
“I’ve been reflecting on how I want to grow here and I’d love to have your support as an advocate. If there are ways I can demonstrate more impact or be more visible to leadership, I’d welcome your advice on how to position myself.”

---

### **Example 11: Playing Favorites on the Team**

**Context:** You notice certain team members consistently receive better opportunities or praise.

**Your response:**  
“I’ve been observing some patterns in the way tasks and recognition are distributed, and it’s making me wonder if there are things I could be doing differently to be considered more often. I’d love to get your input on how I can step up.”

---

### **Example 12: Manager Overpromises and Under-delivers**

**Context:** They keep saying they’ll support your growth or fix something, but don’t follow through.

**What they said:**  
“Next quarter we’ll definitely get you onto that project.”

**Your response:**  
“I’m excited about the idea of contributing to that initiative, and I wanted to follow up since a few months have passed. Is that still a possibility? If not, are there other projects I could get involved in that would support similar learning goals?”

---

### **Example 13: Personal Boundaries Crossed**

**Context:** Your manager reaches out at inappropriate hours or expects responses on personal time.

**What they said:**  
“Can you get me that by tonight?”

**Your response:**  
“I’m committed to delivering high-quality work, and I also want to maintain a sustainable work-life balance. If something is urgent, I’m happy to flex occasionally, but I’d like us to clarify expectations around off-hours communication going forward.”

---

### **Example 14: Unclear Feedback on Expectations**

**Context:** You’re told to “take more ownership” but not what that looks like.

**What they said:**  
“You just need to show more initiative.”

**Your response:**  
“I’m eager to take more initiative and would love a little more specificity. What would ‘more ownership’ look like on this team? Are there examples you’ve seen that I could learn from?”

---

### **Example 15: Conflicting Feedback from Mentor and Direct Manager**

**Context:** You’re being pulled in different directions by a mentor and your official manager.

**What they said (mentor):**  
“You should prioritize your growth goals, even if it means pushing back.”

**What they said (manager):**  
“Focus only on execution and delivery.”

**Your response:**  
“I value both of your guidance, and I’m feeling a little torn between focusing on development versus delivery. Could we align on how to balance both, so I can do right by the team and grow at the same time?”

---

### **Example 16: Vague Criticism Without Solutions**

**Context:** They highlight a problem, but give no guidance on how to improve.

**What they said:**  
“This just isn’t what I expected.”

**Your response:**  
“I want to get it right, and I’m open to feedback. Could we walk through what you expected and what’s missing from my version so I can make changes that better meet your goals?”

---

### **Example 17: Your Manager Invalidates Your Feelings**

**Context:** You express concern about workload or team dynamics, and they brush it off.

**What they said:**  
“You’re probably just overthinking it.”

**Your response:**  
“I appreciate your confidence in me, but this is something I’ve been feeling consistently. I’d like to unpack it a bit more—not to complain, but to understand how we might prevent it from affecting my work.”

---

### **Example 18: Manager Keeps Moving Goalposts**

**Context:** Just as you finish a project, they add new requirements.

**What they said:**  
“I actually need you to redo this in a different format.”

**Your response:**  
“I’m happy to adjust based on new needs. In the future, would it be possible to align on the end goal more clearly upfront so I can save time and deliver exactly what’s needed?”

---

### **Example 19: Manager Makes Inappropriate Jokes or Comments**

**Context:** Your mentor or manager jokes about gender, race, or other sensitive topics.

**What they said:**  
“You’re pretty sharp for someone from [background]. Just kidding!”

**Your response (privately):**  
“I know you meant that as a joke, but it landed uncomfortably for me. I wanted to share that because I value our relationship and want to keep communication open and respectful.”

---

### **Example 20: You Disagree with Their Direction**

**Context:** Your manager makes a decision you strongly disagree with and believe will harm the team.

**What they said:**  
“We’re rolling out this new process starting Monday.”

**Your response:**  
“I’d like to raise a concern about that rollout. Based on what I’ve seen from the team, I’m worried it might cause confusion or resistance. Would you be open to a quick discussion to consider an alternative approach?”
