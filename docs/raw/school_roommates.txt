## Navigating School/Dorm Roommate Situations

**Definition:** Roommates share physical and emotional space — including sleep, study, social life, and stress. Conflict may arise from differences in lifestyle, communication styles, boundaries, or expectations. Positive roommate relationships can also lead to some of the deepest friendships.

---

### Strategy & Principles
- Establish expectations early and revisit them regularly.
- Use “I feel” and “I need” statements — avoid accusations.
- Don’t let resentment simmer — address small issues before they build.
- Respect each other’s right to privacy, sleep, and space.
- Acknowledge that sharing space doesn’t mean sharing everything (time, emotions, values).

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Schedule regular check-ins, even when things are going well.
- Use roommate agreements as a baseline (some schools provide templates).
- When things get tense, ask to talk in a neutral tone and time — not during the moment of conflict.
- Loop in a resident advisor (RA) when resolution isn’t possible one-on-one.
- Celebrate joyful moments: bonding, shared traditions, inside jokes, mutual support.

## 20 Fully Developed Roommate Scenarios

---

### **Example 1: They Leave the Room a Mess**

**Context:** Your roommate’s stuff is constantly on your side of the room or in shared spaces.

**What they said:**  
“Oh, I was going to clean that later. I just haven’t had time.”

**Your response:**  
“I get that things get busy. At the same time, when your stuff’s on my side or left out, it makes it hard for me to relax and focus. Can we set a shared clean-up day each week, or talk about how to keep things more contained?”

---

### **Example 2: Different Sleep Schedules**

**Context:** They go to bed late and keep the lights on while you’re trying to sleep.

**What they said:**  
“I need to study — can’t you just use earplugs or a mask?”

**Your response:**  
“I totally support you studying, but I need rest to function too. Could we compromise with a desk lamp and headphones after midnight, or schedule quiet hours we both stick to?”

---

### **Example 3: They Bring People Over Without Asking**

**Context:** You come back to your room and there are guests there — again.

**What they said:**  
“I figured you wouldn’t mind since you weren’t here.”

**Your response:**  
“I like having people around sometimes, but I’d really appreciate a heads-up. It’s hard to unwind or study when I come back to surprise visitors. Could we agree to check in first before inviting people over?”

---

### **Example 4: You Feel Left Out of Their Social Circle**

**Context:** They hang out with suitemates or classmates but don’t include you.

**What they did:**  
You see them leave for dinner together without inviting you.

**Your response (gentle and not accusatory):**  
“Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve been hanging with the group a lot. I’d love to tag along sometime if you’re open — I’m still trying to find my people.”

---

### **Example 5: You Need Alone Time and They’re Always Around**

**Context:** You’re an introvert and find it hard to recharge when they’re always in the room.

**Your response:**  
“Nothing personal at all, but sometimes I need quiet time to reset. Would you be cool with planning some solo room time once in a while, even if just an hour or two a week?”

---

### **Example 6: They Take or Use Your Stuff Without Asking**

**Context:** Your food, clothes, or chargers are used without permission.

**What they said:**  
“I thought it was fine — we’re roommates!”

**Your response:**  
“I get that we share space, but I’d like us to ask first before borrowing anything. It helps me feel respected and keeps things clear.”

---

### **Example 7: They Don’t Respect Quiet Study Time**

**Context:** You’re studying and they’re playing music or talking on FaceTime.

**What they said:**  
“I’m just chilling — I’ll be done soon.”

**Your response:**  
“I need quiet right now to concentrate. Can we come up with agreed quiet study hours, or give each other a heads-up when we need the space for focus?”

---

### **Example 8: You Have a Fight and Things Are Tense**

**Context:** You had an argument, and now you’re both giving each other the silent treatment.

**Your response (to break the silence):**  
“Hey, I know that got tense. I want to clear the air — I care about having a good vibe in the room. Can we talk when you're ready?”

---

### **Example 9: Their Partner Sleeps Over Frequently**

**Context:** Their significant other is staying over multiple nights a week.

**Your response:**  
“I don’t mind occasional overnights, but it’s starting to feel like I have two roommates. Can we talk about a balance that feels comfortable for both of us?”

---

### **Example 10: They Have Different Cleanliness Standards**

**Context:** You’re tidy, and they’re not — dishes sit for days, garbage piles up.

**What they said:**  
“I don’t think it’s that messy.”

**Your response:**  
“I know we see it differently, but when things get too messy, it affects my mood and focus. Could we agree on a basic standard for cleaning the shared space?”

---

### **Example 11: You’re the One Who Messed Up**

**Context:** You played loud music during their midterm prep.

**What you said:**  
“Hey, I realized I was being loud earlier. I wasn’t thinking about your schedule. I’m really sorry and will be more careful next time.”

---

### **Example 12: Joyful Moment — You Watch a Movie Together and Bond**

**Context:** You both stayed in on a Friday and ended up laughing through a movie.

**What they said:**  
“We should do this more often.”

**Your response:**  
“Agreed. This was the chill night I needed. Let’s start a roommate movie night — we could rotate who picks!”

---

### **Example 13: They Cry or Get Upset in the Room**

**Context:** They’re having a tough time emotionally.

**Your response (if you're not close yet):**  
“Hey, no pressure to talk, but I’m here if you need anything — want me to grab tea or give you some space?”

---

### **Example 14: You Feel Like the Room Isn’t Yours Anymore**

**Context:** They dominate decorations, lighting, music, and storage.

**Your response:**  
“I’d love to feel like the space reflects both of us a bit more. Can we maybe rearrange or designate a few shared zones we both get input on?”

---

### **Example 15: You Want to Switch Rooms But Don’t Want to Offend**

**Context:** You want a room change, but it’s not because you hate them — you just need a different setup.

**Your response:**  
“I wanted to let you know I’ve requested a room switch. It’s more about needing a different living style — I appreciate living with you this semester, and I hope we stay on good terms.”

---

### **Example 16: They're Going Through Something Serious**

**Context:** They’ve confided in you about mental health or family issues.

**Your response:**  
“Thanks for trusting me with that. Just know I’m here, and if it ever feels bigger than what a friend can handle, I can go with you to talk to someone.”

---

### **Example 17: They Talk About You to Others**

**Context:** You overhear them complaining about you to mutual friends.

**What they said:**  
“Ugh, they’re so uptight — I can’t deal.”

**Your response (calmly):**  
“Hey, I overheard part of what you said earlier. If there’s something I’m doing that’s bothering you, I’d rather we talk about it directly. I’m open to hearing it.”

---

### **Example 18: Joyful Moment — Inside Jokes and Traditions**

**Context:** You invent a nickname for your 2 a.m. ramen habit and start a roommate tradition.

**What they said:**  
“Okay, Ramen Royalty, is it time?”

**Your response:**  
“It’s officially our tradition now. We’ll remember this stuff way more than lectures.”

---

### **Example 19: Awkward First Week Energy**

**Context:** You’re both polite but it feels forced.

**Your response:**  
“Hey, I know the first week of roommate stuff can feel awkward. Want to do a quick coffee run and get to know each other outside of the room?”

---

### **Example 20: Mid-Semester Check-In**

**Context:** Things are going fine, but you want to prevent future issues.

**Your response:**  
“Things seem to be going pretty smoothly, which I really appreciate. Do you want to do a quick check-in to make sure we’re still on the same page with shared stuff like guests and cleaning?”
