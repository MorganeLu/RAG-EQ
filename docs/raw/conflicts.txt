**“I may have caused some misunderstanding — I apologize for the trouble. I value our relationship and hope to move forward with care.”**

→ Be indirect but respectful, prioritize preserving dignity.

---

### When Formality Matters (e.g., France, Germany, India in professional settings)

**“I acknowledge the mistake on my part regarding [specific issue]. Please accept my sincere apologies and assurance that corrective steps are in place.”**

→ Stay professional, concrete, and specific.
