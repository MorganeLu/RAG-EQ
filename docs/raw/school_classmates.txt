## 6. Navigating Relationships with Classmates

### Strategy & Principles
- Prioritize mutual respect, emotional safety, and collaboration.
- Use curiosity over judgment: “What’s going on here?” rather than “What’s wrong with them?”
- Communicate boundaries calmly and clearly.
- Practice repair — it’s okay to make mistakes in relationships if you take ownership.
- Celebrate joy and vulnerability — school isn’t just about learning content, but learning people.

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Classmate relationships are peer-based and fluid — you may work closely for a project, then drift.
- Don’t let small conflicts build into major tension — clear the air early and kindly.
- Academic competition, identity differences, and group dynamics can all create pressure — be mindful of the unspoken.
- Use “I” statements to reduce blame and create safety.
- Be intentional about including others in joyful or casual moments — small acts build long-term belonging.
