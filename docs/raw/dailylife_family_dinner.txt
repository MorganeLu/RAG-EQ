## Who You Might Toast

### 1. **To Elders**  
Show deep respect — thank them for their guidance, love, and presence.

### 2. **To Siblings & Cousins**  
Keep it lighthearted — celebrate shared memories, tease a little, and express your bond.

### 3. **To Younger Family Members**  
Use juice or soda to toast kids or younger cousins — encourage them or offer fun blessings.

### 4. **To Relatives Visiting from Afar**  
Welcome them warmly and thank them for making the effort to join.

### 5. **To Family Who Don’t Drink Alcohol**  
Offer tea or juice — it’s the gesture that matters, not the drink.

### 6. **To New Family Members or Newcomers**  
Make in-laws, new partners, or friends feel included and appreciated.
