## Navigating Daily Life with Strangers

**Definition:** Strangers are people you don’t know personally — like peers in a cafeteria, folks in a shared public space, fellow students in a large lecture, cashiers, airport seatmates, or online commenters. These interactions are brief, but your ability to **handle tension or connection respectfully** leaves a lasting mark — on them, and on you.

---

### Strategy & Principles
- Lead with kindness — you don’t know their story.
- Set boundaries clearly but calmly when needed.
- De-escalate, don’t dominate — stay grounded in your values.
- Assume misunderstandings before malice.
- Small positive interactions can transform someone’s day.

---

### Role-Specific Tips
- Respect personal space, tone, and safety — especially in public.
- With aggressive strangers, stay non-confrontational and prioritize exit or support.
- Use bystander skills: support others in uncomfortable situations.
- Online, follow the same values as in person — don’t dehumanize.
- If the moment allows, practice generosity — eye contact, compliments, small gestures.
